# S16-G24-PressSOS
PressSOS is a safety app for emergency situations that allows its users to alert the app if ever they are in danger and/or in need of help. When a user clicks the app’s emergency button, a text message will be sent to their listed emergency contact/s every 5 minutes informing his/her emergency contact/s of his/her location, and will only be turned off once the SOS button has also been turned off. A sound alarm will also go off from the user’s device upon the activation of the app’s emergency button. The user has the option to turn this alarm off. Once the app has successfully messaged the user’s emergency contact person/s, a notification will be sent to the user as confirmation.
